# Inteligência Artificial - Practical Labs

This repository contains the practical lab work for the **"Inteligência Artificial" (Artificial Intelligence)** course, part of the **Bachelor's Degree in Informatics Engineering** at the **University of Aveiro**.

## Lab Summaries

### Lab 1: Python Programming
- **Objective**: Master Python programming concepts critical for AI, including recursion, functional programming, and object-oriented design.
- **Key Topics**:
  - Recursive functions for list processing.
  - Lambda expressions and higher-order functions.
  - Sorting algorithms (selection, bubble, quick sort).
  - Binary trees, arithmetic expressions, and genealogical relationships.
- **Document**: [Lab 1 Guide](./guiao-de-programacao-funcional-tomasf18/guiao-prog.pdf).

### Lab 2: Knowledge Representation and Inference
- **Objective**: Develop and extend a semantic network module and explore Bayesian networks.
- **Key Topics**:
  - Implementing semantic networks with associations, subtypes, and membership relations.
  - Extending semantic networks with advanced queries (e.g., inheritance, cancellation, and induction).
  - Creating and analyzing Bayesian networks.
- **Document**: [Lab 2 Guide](./guiao-rc-tomasf18/guiao-rc-en.pdf).

### Lab 3: Search Algorithms
- **Objective**: Implement uninformed and informed search strategies in AI.
- **Key Topics**:
  - Uninformed search: Breadth-first search, depth-first search.
  - Informed search: Greedy search, A* algorithm.
  - Heuristic design and evaluation.
- **Document**: [Lab 3 Guide](./guiao-sobre-pesquisa-tomasf18/guiao-pesquisa-en.pdf).
